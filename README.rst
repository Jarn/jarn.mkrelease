Python package releaser
---------------------------------------------------

**mkrelease** is a no-frills Python package releaser. It is designed to take
the cumber out of building and distributing Python packages.

mkrelease supports source distributions, binary eggs, and `wheels`_.

.. _`wheels`: https://wheel.readthedocs.io/

Motivation
==========

After preparing a package for release (update version strings, dates,
etc.), we typically have to:

1. Commit modified files.

2. Tag the release.

3. Build a source distribution, egg, or wheel.

4. Distribute the result via scp or upload it to an index server.

Now imagine doing this a lot, and the need for automation becomes
obvious.

Installation
============

mkrelease works with Python 2.6 - 3.6 and all released versions of setuptools
and distribute.

Use ``pip install jarn.mkrelease`` to install the ``mkrelease`` script.

Usage
=====

``mkrelease [options] [scm-sandbox | scm-url [rev]]``

Options
=======

``-C, --no-commit``
    Do not commit modified files from the sandbox.

``-T, --no-tag``
    Do not tag the release in SCM.

``-R, --no-register``
    Do not register the release with dist-location.

``-S, --no-upload``
    Do not upload the release to dist-location.

``-n, --dry-run``
    Dry-run; equivalent to ``-CTRS``.

``--svn, --hg, --git``
    Select the SCM type. Only required if the SCM type
    cannot be guessed from the argument.

``-d dist-location, --dist-location=dist-location``
    An scp or sftp destination specification, an index
    server configured in ``~/.pypirc``, or an alias name for
    either. This option may be specified more than once.

``-s, --sign``
    Sign the release with GnuPG.

``-i identity, --identity=identity``
    The GnuPG identity to sign with. Implies ``-s``.

``-z, --zip``
    Release a zip archive (the default).

``-g, --gztar``
    Release a tar.gz archive.

``-b, --binary``
    Release a binary egg.

``-w, --wheel``
    Release a wheel file.

``-p, --push``
    Push sandbox modifications upstream.

``-m, --manifest-only``
    Do not gather files via setuptools extensions (i.e. rely
    on defaults and ``MANIFEST.in`` only.)

``-e, --develop``
    Allow additional version tags (i.e. don't ignore
    respective ``setup.cfg`` options.) Implies ``-T``.

``-q, --quiet``
    Suppress output of setuptools commands.

``-c config-file, --config-file=config-file``
    Use config-file instead of the default ``~/.mkrelease``.

``-l, --list-locations``
    List known dist-locations and exit.

``-h, --help``
    Print the help message and exit.

``-v, --version``
    Print the version string and exit.

``scm-sandbox``
    A local SCM sandbox. Defaults to the current working
    directory.

``scm-url [rev]``
    The URL of a remote SCM repository. The optional ``rev`` argument
    specifies a branch or tag to check out.

Examples
========

Release my.package and upload it to PyPI::

  $ mkrelease -d pypi src/my.package

Release my.package using the repository URL instead of a local working copy::

  $ mkrelease -d pypi git@github.com:Jarn/my.package

Release my.package and upload it via scp to the jarn.com server::

  $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/public src/my.package

Release a development egg of my.package while suppressing setuptools output::

  $ mkrelease -qed stefan@jarn.com:eggs src/my.package

Configuration
=============

mkrelease reads available index servers from the distutils configuration
file ``~/.pypirc``. This file must contain your PyPI account information::

  [distutils]
  index-servers =
      pypi

  [pypi]
  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = fred
  password = secret
  register = no

mkrelease also reads its own configuration file ``~/.mkrelease``.
Here's an example::

  [mkrelease]
  distdefault = public
  formats = zip
  push = yes
  quiet = no

  [aliases]
  public =
      jarn.com:/var/dist/public
  customerA =
      jarn.com:/var/dist/customerA
  world =
      pypi
      public

Armed with this configuration we can shorten example 3 to::

  $ mkrelease -d public src/my.package

And because ``public`` is the default location, we can omit ``-d`` entirely::

  $ mkrelease src/my.package

Upload with SCP
================

The simplest distribution location is a server directory shared through
Apache. Releasing a package means scp-ing it to the appropriate place
on the server::

  $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/customerB src/my.package

To upload via sftp instead of scp, specify the destination in URL form::

  $ mkrelease -d sftp://jarn.com/var/dist/customerB src/my.package

For consistency, scp URLs are supported as well::

  $ mkrelease -d scp://jarn.com/var/dist/customerB src/my.package

Note: Unlike scp, the sftp client does not prompt for login credentials.
This means that non-interactive login must be configured on the
destination server or the upload will fail.

Upload to Index Servers
==========================

Another way of distributing Python packages is by uploading them to dedicated
index servers, notably PyPI. Given the ``~/.pypirc`` file from above
we can release to PyPI by typing::

  $ mkrelease -d pypi src/my.package

Index servers are not limited to PyPI though.
There is test.pypi.org, and there are alternative index servers like
`devpi`_.

.. _`devpi`: http://doc.devpi.net/

We extend our ``~/.pypirc`` to add an additional server::

  [distutils]
  index-servers =
      pypi
      test

  [pypi]
  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = fred
  password = secret
  register = no

  [test]
  repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = fred
  password = secret
  register = no

This allows us to release to test.pypi.org by typing::

  $ mkrelease -CT -d test src/my.package

Note: Setuptools rebuilds the package for every index server it uploads it to.
This means that MD5 sums and GnuPG signatures will differ between servers.
If this is not what you want, upload to only one server and distribute from
there by other means.

Releasing a Tag
===============

Release my.package from an existing tag::

  $ mkrelease -T -d pypi git@github.com:Jarn/my.package 1.0

Using GnuPG
===========

Release my.package and sign the archive with GnuPG::

  $ mkrelease -s -i fred@bedrock.com -d pypi src/my.package

The ``-i`` flag is optional and GnuPG will pick your default
key if not given. Defaults for ``-s`` and ``-i`` may be
configured in ``~/.pypirc``::

  [pypi]
  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  username = fred
  password = secret
  register = no
  sign = yes
  identity = fred@bedrock.com

Requirements
============

The following commands must be available on the system PATH (you only need
what you plan to use):

* svn

* hg

* git

* scp

* sftp

* gpg

Keyring Support
===============

On Mac OS X, mkrelease installs the `keyring`_ module which provides access
to the Mac OS X Keychain. To store your PyPI password in the Keychain type::

  $ keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ <pypi-username>

Then delete the password line from ``~/.pypirc``.

Note: `keyring`_ works on other platforms but because of C-language
dependencies you have to install it yourself.
