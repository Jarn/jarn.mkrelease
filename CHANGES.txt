2.0.2 - 2009-08-29
------------------

- Filter meta files (``.svn*``, ``.hg*``, ``.git*``) and never include
  them in releases.
  [stefan]

- Make sure to clean up all temporary files.
  [stefan]

2.0.1 - 2009-07-24
------------------

- Fixed bug which could cause mkrelease to issue eggs with faulty manifest
  files (Symptom: data files not installed).
  [stefan]

- The -e flag now implies -T. We never want to tag a development release.
  [stefan]

2.0 - 2009-07-16
----------------

- Allow command line options to appear after the argument. As in:
  ``mkrelease src/my.package -q -d pypi``.
  [stefan]

2.0b2 - 2009-07-09
------------------

- Improve user feedback in the SCM-detection part.
  [stefan]

2.0b1 - 2009-07-03

- By default, ignore all version number extensions (dev-r12345)
  that may be configured in setup.cfg. Passing the -e flag
  disables this safeguard.
  [witsch, stefan]

- Delete any existing signature file before signing anew. This keeps
  GnuPG from complaining about existing (but left-over) files.
  [stefan]

2.0a2 - 2009-06-27
------------------

- Drop configurable Python and use sys.executable. This also means we
  now require Python 2.6.
  [stefan]

- Force setuptools to only use file-finders for the selected SCM type.
  This is required to support multi-SCM sandboxes (think git-svn).
  [stefan]

- Treat Subversion sandboxes just like the others and avoid the
  temporary checkout step.
  [stefan]

  [stefan]

1.0b4 - 2009-04-30
------------------

- Since distutils commands may return 0, successful or not, we must
  check their output for signs of failure.
