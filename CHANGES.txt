2.0 - 2009-07-16
----------------

- Allow command line options to appear after the argument. As in:
  ``mkrelease src/my.package -q -d pypi``.

  GnuPG from complaining about existing (but left-over) files.

------------------

- Drop configurable Python and use sys.executable. This also means we

  [stefan]

- Force setuptools to only use file-finders for the selected SCM type.
  This is required to support multi-SCM sandboxes (think git-svn).
  [stefan]

- Treat Subversion sandboxes just like the others and avoid the
  temporary checkout step.
